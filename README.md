## UNCW Navigator

UNCW Navigator was a project I worked on in my mobile application class my senior year. This project had the option to work in a group but I choose to go solo.

You are able to create an account and save specific buildings for easy access for later use. You can explore buildings and see a description of the building. There is also the ability to search for a building by its name. For this project I also have a demo video that is available to download and watch if that is of interest.

There is a screenshot below of on possible route that was taken for the conversation.
