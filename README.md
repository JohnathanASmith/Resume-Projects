## Pawpals

### Overview of project
Pawpals was a project I worked on for my software engineering class my senior year. This project was made up of five people including me. We worked on this project the whole semester and preseneted it at a showcase for all the projects completed that semester.

### What is PawPals?
_Paw Pals_, allows users to view and/or list adoptable pets.  Users will have access to a feed that is personalized to them based on their pet preferences.  The user will be able to view details about a given pet in their feed and choose whether or not to "favorite" the pets that appear.  In addition, the system will also allow users to list adoptable pets.  _Paw Pals_ is the perfect tool for any individual/organization looking to browse adoptable pets or list them to get adopted!

## UNCW Navigator

### Overview of Project
UNCW Navigator was a project I worked on in my mobile application class my senior year. This project had the option to work in a group but I choose to go solo. This project was worked on for most of the semester in milestones. 

### What is UNCW Navigator?
UNCW navigator is a mobile application that gives the user access to a map of campus or any campus that it is set to and gives the ability to get directions and explore campus. You are able to create an account and save specific buildings for easy access for later use. You can explore buildings and see a description of the building. There is also the ability to search for a building by its name. For this project I also have a demo video that is available to download and watch if that is of interest. The video is in the UNCW Navigator section of this repository as a mp4.

### Platform
_UNCW Navigator_ is a _**mobile application**_.
